is that possible to code jcl and rexx using chatgpt to export ibm tso sdsf da queue to a file?

Yes, it's absolutely possible to use JCL and REXX, with help from ChatGPT, to automate the export of the SDSF DA queue (Display Active jobs) on IBM z/OS (TSO) to a dataset or file.

Here's how it works at a high level:


---

1. What you need to do

Use REXX to interact with SDSF panels (SDSF API via ISFEXEC).

Use JCL to run the REXX script in batch.

Capture the SDSF DA panel output (the list of active jobs).

Write that output to a dataset.



---

2. REXX Code Example

This REXX example will access SDSF's DA panel and write the job list to a dataset:

/* REXX */
ADDRESS TSO
"ISFEXEC DA"

if rc Â¬= 0 then do
  say "SDSF DA access failed with RC=" rc
  exit 8
end

if queued() = 0 then do
  say "No active jobs found."
  exit 0
end

/* Open output dataset for writing */
"ALLOCATE DD(OUTDD) DSN('YOUR.OUTPUT.DATASET') SHR REUSE"
"EXECIO * DISKW OUTDD (STEM ISFLINE. FINIS"

exit 0

3. JCL to Run REXX in Batch

//SDSFJOB  JOB (ACCT),'REXX SDSF',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,DYNAMNBR=20
//SYSPROC  DD DSN=YOUR.REXX.LIBRARY,DISP=SHR
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN  DD *
  %REXXNAME
//OUTDD    DD DSN=YOUR.OUTPUT.DATASET,DISP=SHR

Replace:

YOUR.REXX.LIBRARY with the library containing your REXX script.

REXXNAME with the name of your REXX script.

YOUR.OUTPUT.DATASET with the dataset to receive the output.



---

4. Requirements

You need access to SDSF API from REXX (ISFEXEC).

The user ID running the job must have the authority to access SDSF and view the DA panel.

SDSF is required to be in ISF mode, not the older HT mode.

Would you like a ready-to-copy example with all placeholders filled out, or something more specific like filtering by jobname or writing in a certain format (CSV, plain, etc.)?
